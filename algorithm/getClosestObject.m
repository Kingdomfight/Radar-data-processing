classdef getClosestObject < matlab.System
	% System object to calculate which tracked obstacle from input array trackedObs
	% is closest to input obstacle detectObs.
	% Input trackedObs is an array of structs containing at least the following fields:
	%   tracking: logical type used to check if obstacle is being tracked or not.
	%   pxExt: extrapolated x coordinate.
	%   pyExt: extrapolated y coordinate.
	% Input detectObs is a struct containing at elast the following fields:
	%   px: x coordinate of detected obstacle
	%   py: y coordinate of detected obstacle
	% Output c uses one-hot encoding to indicate the closest obstacle in trackedObs.
	% If there are no tracked obstacles in trackedObs, c is 0.
